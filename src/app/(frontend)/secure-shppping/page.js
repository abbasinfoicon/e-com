              <p>On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and
                demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot
                foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail
                in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil
                and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our
                power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like
                best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and
                owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that
                pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in
                these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater
                pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.</p>
